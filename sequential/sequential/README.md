# Sequential Circuits

This folder contains Verilog implementations of basic sequential logic elements.

## Included Designs

### 🔹 D Flip-Flop (DFF)
Edge-triggered flip-flop that stores input data on the clock edge.

---

### 🔹 JK Flip-Flop (JKFF)
Flip-flop with toggle functionality based on J and K inputs.

---

### 🔹 T Flip-Flop (TFF)
Toggle flip-flop that changes state when T = 1.

---

### 🔹 NAND Latch
SR Latch implemented using NAND gates.

---

### 🔹 NOR Latch
SR Latch implemented using NOR gates.
