# Logic Gates

This folder contains Verilog implementations of basic logic gates and different modeling techniques.

## Included Designs

### 🔹 Basic Logic Gates
Implementation of fundamental gates:
- AND
- OR
- NOT
- NAND
- NOR
- XOR
- XNOR

---

### 🔹 Logic Gates using Multiplexer (MUX)
Implementation of logic gates using multiplexers.

This demonstrates how Boolean functions can be realized using MUX-based design.

---

### 🔹 AND Gate using UDP (User Defined Primitive)
Implementation of an AND gate using Verilog UDP.

This demonstrates low-level modeling capability in Verilog.
