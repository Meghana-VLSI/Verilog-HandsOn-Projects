# Memory Designs

This folder contains Verilog implementations of various memory-related and sequence generation designs.

## Included Designs

### 🔹 LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register)
LFSR is used for pseudo-random number generation.

- Feedback-based shift register
- Used in cryptography and testing applications
- Generates repeating binary sequences

---

### 🔹 RAM (Random Access Memory)
Implementation of basic RAM in Verilog.

- Read and Write operations
- Address-based data access
- Synchronous design

---

### 🔹 ROM (Read Only Memory)
Implementation of ROM in Verilog.

- Predefined stored data
- Read-only access
- Address-based output

---

### 🔹 FIFO (First In First Out)
Implementation of FIFO memory structure.

- Data stored in queue format
- Write and Read control signals
- Useful in buffering and data transfer systems

---
