# Counters

This folder contains different types of counter implementations using Verilog HDL.

## Included Designs

### 🔹 Up Counter
Increments the count value by 1 on every clock pulse.

### 🔹 Down Counter
Decrements the count value by 1 on every clock pulse.

### 🔹 Up-Down Counter
Counts up or down based on a control signal.
- Control = 1 → Count Up
- Control = 0 → Count Down

### 🔹 Clock Divider
Divides the input clock frequency to generate a slower clock signal.
